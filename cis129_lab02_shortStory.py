#Prints a simple short story
print(There was once a kid whose dream was becoming like his father, a big tech company CEO) 
print(He thought it would be impossible to overcome him due to his success and was scared he was going to be his shadow forever) 
print(He took this to heart and learned whatever he could from his Father's company and started working on his in secret) 
print(He later created a videogame using virtual Reality and broke the videogame market, creating a name for himself and getting the praise from his dad)
print(They later merged their companies and worked together towards new goals together.)
